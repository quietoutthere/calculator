## Description

This was a very mentally taxing, yet, rewarding project to complete. I am quite proud of the logic I came up with on my main.js. I really had to focus on conceptualizing statements being 'truthy' / 'falsey' in order for the project to come together. The stylesheet is basic and has an analog / 80s arcade feel.
